# Data Modeling Practice

Now that's you've learned about non-relational databases and how to structure
them with schemas, let's practice looking at actual data sets and creating a
structure based on the documents inside of them.

## Prerequisites

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Data Modeling & Schemas

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in the `data-sets` directory. You are required to turn
in your submission by making a pull request on the original repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

## Requirements

In the `data-sets` directory, you'll find a few subdirectories. Each of these
subdirectories contains a `json` file with a data set. Based on the data set,
create a file representing each model that includes:

- Proper naming convention of the model's `js` file
- A variable `Schema` set equal to `mongoose.Schema`
- Model defined using the `Schema` method
- Properties that correlate with the data set
- Appropriate data types and validation for each property
- Export schema using `module.exports`

For example, for the data set:

```js
[
  {
    "name": "Erin",
    "hometown": "Villanova, PA",
    "yearsInDC": 8,
    "lovesToCode": true
  }
];
```

Your model file (named `Person.js` or something else semantic, should look like
this:

```js
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const Person = new Schema({
  name: String,
  hometown: String,
  yearsInDC: Number,
  lovesToCode: Boolean
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Person", Person);
```

For the examples that require parent and child schemas, use the Author and
Cookbook solution that we learning in class as a reference! Hint: An array of
objects will be a clue!

## Testing Your Work

How can you tell if your model works?

Create an `index.js` file (or something) inside the folders for each prompt.
Inside that file, import your model and import the seed data. Insert the seed
data into your database with your model. Then check it in the MongoDB shell.

If the data you see in MongoDB matches the data in the json file, then your
model is working! If you get an error or some data is missing, then you have
some work to do still.
