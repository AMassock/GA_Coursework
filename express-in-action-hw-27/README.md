# Express in Action

In this lab, you'll practice and learn about (a) reading technical books and (b)
building APIs with Express.

Technical books can be an incredibly effective way of learning about coding
concepts and libraries. But many developers find them slow and difficult to work
with. This often comes back to picking a book that is too hard or too easy and
using a poor reading strategies.

In this lab, you'll work through a few chapters of the book [Express in
Action](./Express-in-Action.pdf), a book about working with Express.
