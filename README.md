## Future Plans/Issues

In the future we would like to include User Authorization/Profiles, and holding images to serve up to the front end.

We ran into multiple issues with CORS and CORB. The CORS issues were resolved by adding CORS and a configuration to allow access from all sites. We are still having an issue with CORB as this is a Chromium security precaution.
