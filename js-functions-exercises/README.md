# Functions Exercise

## Prerequisites

* Data Types
* Functions

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

## Requirements

Inside of the provided `challenge.js` file, write a function for each bullet
point below.

**Write one function per bullet point. Write a function that:**

- Console logs "hello"
- Console logs "world"
- Takes a parameter called "name" and console logs it
- Takes a parameter called "name" and console logs "hello" + name
- Takes a parameter called "number" and multiplies it by itself, then console
  logs the result

**These functions should all return something. Each should:**

- Take a number as a parameter and return itself squared.
- Have 3 optional parameters, all numbers. Add all the numbers together. If the
  function is called without passing any arugments (ie: the numbers), simply return 10.
- Take a number and add some amount of zeroes to the end, returning it (make
  sure you return a number, not a string)
- return a function that console logs 'hello world' (yes you can write functions
  inside functions!)

**Also, write some functions with side effects:**

- Declare a variable, assigning a string to it. Then write a function that
  modifies that string without returning anything.
- Declare a variable, assigning an array that contains 5 numbers to it. Then
  write a function that removes the first item from the array.

**Lastly:**

- Write two functions that do the same thing, but one returns the value and the
  other modifies a variable with side effects.
- The functions should both add the string "flabbergasted" on to the end of an
    array
