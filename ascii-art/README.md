# ASCII Art

> feat. `for` loops and pair programming

## Instructions

For this lab you will be getting into pairs and working together. One person should fork the repository and add their partner as a collaborator. Work on one computer at a time, ensuring that you alternate and switch drivers at some point.

### How does pairing work?

> Put simply, _"One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. **The two programmers switch roles frequently.**" (from Wikipedia) _

Think of the driver and navigator as guidelines for your roles. You will both verbalize your problem-solving thought process _and also_ act as a sounding board for the person you work with. Make sure to _strive for a balance_ of coming up with ideas and listening to the ideas of your partner.

People tend to feel more self-conscious and mistake-prone when people are watching over our shoulder. The role of the navigator isn't necessarily to _critically review_ the code the driver is typing in, but has a more holistic role of guiding the conversation and relieving the driver of some of the cognitive labor.

## Lab Exercise

> _from [the npm package `getdogs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/getdogs)_.

For this exercise, we're going to do something more manageable than the photorealistic ASCII art shown above. We're going to draw a few shapes using `for` loops in the browser console using `console.log()`. The exercise contains four parts, but the basic `for` loop can re-used with each part of this lab.

The goal isn't to finish all four, which are altogether more than one could get done in a couple hours, at least at this point in your web development journey.

### Part I: ASCII Art Square

Draw a square using a for-loop. You may build a 10x10 square to start, but you also may draw any rectangle. You may use any characters of your choosing, including emojis. While the examples appear more rectangular, they are 10x10.

**The requirement for Part II is to print two triangles, that match the following pattern below!**
```

There are two simple approaches to this problem that come to mind...

#### Rows in an Array

One might involve storing each row in an array, iterating over the array with a for-loop, and printing out each item in the array in a for loop.

> Run this code in your browser console (CMD+OPT+I in _Chrome_)

```js
var kardashians = ["Kim", "Khlo√©", "Kourtney"];
for (var index = 0; index < kardashians.length; index++) {
  console.log(kardashians[index]);
}
```

For loops are often used to iterate over arrays, meaning to go through an array, item by item, and do something with it. In this example, we are `console.log`ging each string in the `kardashians` array.

#### String Concatenation

String concatenation is a complicated-sounding way of saying joining strings together.

Try playing around with the examples below...

```js
var coolWord = "spatula";
console.log(coolWord);
var coolWords = "spatula" + " city";
console.log(coolWords);

var buildMeUpString = "";
buildMeUpString = buildMeUpString + "I came from nothing!";
console.log(buildMeUpString);
buildMeUpString += " Now I have 2 sentences!";
console.log(buildMeUpString);
buildMeUpString += " I am growing so quickly.";
console.log(buildMeUpString);
```

### Part III: ASCII Art Pyramid
**The requirement for Part III is to print out a pyramid and a reverse pyramid, such as the two examples below:**
```
     ^
    ^^^
   ^^^^^
  ^^^^^^^
 ^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^
```

```
WWWWWWW
 WWWWW
  WWW
   W
```

Count the blocks in each part of the pyramid? What do they have in common? Are these numbers even and odd, all odd, or all even?

There are at least a couple approaches possible here...

### Modifying the for-loop

With the for loops we've seen so far, we've been counting by 1. What if we counted by a different value? Think about the third term in the for loop, which so far has been something like `index++`. [Check this article on addition assignments here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment_Operators#Addition_assignment).

### Modulus

We could also bring a conditional statement into our for-loops. How can we check for evenness or oddness? The modulus operator `%` can be used to determine evenness or oddness. The mathematical term for this is **parity**.

The modulus operator `%` determine how much of a remainder is left after performing integer division on two numbers: `3 % 2` will return the result `1`, since `1` is what remainder after `3` is integer-divided by `2`. With modulus or integer divison, we're in the land of integers where no decimals exist.

We can determine the **parity**, or whether or not a number is even, by checking to see if it is divisible by 2. You have already seen this for fizzbuzz with 3 and 5.

```js
var number = 2;
var otherNumber = 3;

if (number % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("number is even");
} else {
  console.log("number is odd");
}

if (otherNumber % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("otherNumber is even");
} else {
  console.log("otherNumber is odd");
}
```

#### Spacing

You can build your own spacing string to add to the front of the row. There is also a recently added String method called `.padStart`, too. Check out [`.padStart` on Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)...](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart)

### Part IV: Calendar (Bonus)

> Example, Jan 2018

```
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
    1  2  3  4  5  6
 7  8  9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 29 30 31
```

It may be helpful to define some constant values for use with your `for` loop.

> Hint...

```js
const DAYS_IN_MONTH = 31;
const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
```
