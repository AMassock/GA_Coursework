# Fizz Buzz Documentation Challenge

We're going to build a common programming game, Fizz Buzz. For this challenge,
you are only allowed to use the Python documentation!

## Prerequisites

- Another programming language

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.py`](lib/challenge.py). A pull
request is not required, but it is necessary if you want a code review.

## Requirements

Implement Fizz Buzz, up to 100, in the `challenge.py` file provided.

Fizz Buzz works by counting from 0 up to a certain number (in this case 100).
For each number:

* If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print `fizz`
* If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print `buzz`
* If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, print `fizzbuzz`
* Otherwise, just print the number

### Documentation

For this exercise, you are only allowed to use the [Python
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html). That means no Google,
Stack Overflow, or any other website.

This exercise is going to be challenging, but if you find it frustrating then
you need to rethink your approach. The point is to show you that programming is
independent of any programming language. Once you know programmatic thinking,
building something in another programming language is mostly a matter of
learning the new language's syntax.

### Extra

- You can execute a python file with `python3 /path/to/file.py`
- ***Pseudocode***

## Bonus

Make it so a user can pass in a number as an argument and have your program run
up to that number. So if I run `python3 lib/challenge.py 1000`, your program
will run Fizz Buzz up to 1000.
