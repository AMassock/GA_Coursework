# Part I: React Router

This version of the application should use the data provided in
[`/src/data/parks.json`](./src/data/parks.json). Pass this data into the `<App
/>` component from inside `index.js` (i.e. follow [Thinking in
React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html))

Your national parks app should have the following features:

## 1. Navigation

No matter what route the user is visiting, they should always see a navigation
bar at the top of the window. Clicking the title should take the user back to
the homepage.

## 2. Park List (`/`)

If the user visits your application's home page (i.e. `localhost:3000`), they
should see the list of parks. The images and names for these links should be
pulled from [`src/data/parks.json`](./src/data/parks.json).

## 3. Park Detail (`/park/:id`)

Every object in the `parks.json` data has an `id` property which uniquely
identifies each object. We want to use this in the url so we can link to
individual parks. If a user visits a url that follows the `park/:id` pattern,
find the object with that id from the parks data and render that to the user.
This is called `params`.
