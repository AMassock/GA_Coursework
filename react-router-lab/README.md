# React Router & APIs

For today's lab, you'll be building out a small website for the National Parts.
The lab will be broken up into two parts:

1. Build a React app that uses `react-router`
2. Communicate with a 3rd-party API

## Prerequisites

- React
- Components
- Props and state
- React Router

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Run `create-react-app`
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

You will be building out a website listing all of the National Parks.

### Part I: [React Router](part-i.md)

Start by building out the app using React, React Router, and the static data
provided in [`src/data/parks.json`](./src/data/parks.json). Get the site working
with this static data, then integrate with the [National Parks
API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm) and make it look like the
mock. For now, just pass the data around and create an MVP version with minimal
styling so you know it's working. This process should feel familiar ([Read
More](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react)).

Your root level component (`App`) should hold all the data for the application
and pass it down to the different pages, as necessary.

### Part II: [Adding APIs](part-ii.md)

Once you have it working with the static data, get it working with the
[National Parks API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm).

You should only need to add a Fetch request that sets the API response data to
state.

### Part III [Make it look like the mock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJS8ysB1N9Kp89_V_loagQiFNU_4jZoN/view?usp=sharing)

Now that all your data and pages are in place, make your site look like the
provided mock.
