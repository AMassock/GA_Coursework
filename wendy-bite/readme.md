# Wendy Bite

Your client, Wendy, has created "pixel-perfect" images representing how she
wants her website to look, and provided the text. Make her site!

## Prerequisites

- Git
- HTML
- CSS

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/`](lib/). You are required to turn in your
submission by making a pull request on the original repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

## Requirements

Create a css file inside the `lib/` directory and add the link to it inside of
the `index.html` file.

Once you've linked your css file to the `index.html` file, write the CSS
necessary to make your website look exactly like the following mock:

### CSS Validation

Your client knows a thing or two about web design, so be sure your HTML and CSS
validate.

To check whether your CSS validates, use this site:

https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input

## Special Characters

You will notice that certain characters do not render properly. For example,
this appears in the header: `RÃ©sumÃ©`. You need to fix this! Start by Googling
"strange HTML characters".

## Bonus

Create an HTML document for the resume page and build out the HTML and CSS for
it to look like this mock:
