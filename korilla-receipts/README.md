# Korilla React Receipts

Korilla is a Korean barbecue taco truck that makes thousands of hungry customers
happy every year.

Their CEO is thinking of updating their short order tracking system using React.

Build a prototype of this short order receipts tracker.

## Prerequisites

- React

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies (`npm install`).
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

## Requirements

Follow the walkthrough and finish all parts. If you have extra time, finish the
bonus as well.

## Part 1: Sample Receipts

You'll be rendering some sample receipts:

```js
const receipt1 = {
  person: "Karolin",
  order: {
    main: "Burrito",
    protein: "Organic Tofu",
    rice: "Purple Rice",
    sauce: "Green Crack",
    toppings: ["Baby Bok Choy", "Cucumber Kimchi"],
    drink: "Korchata",
    cost: 22
  },
  paid: false
};
const receipt2 = {
  person: "Jerrica",
  order: {
    main: "Rice Bowl",
    protein: "Ginger Soy Chix",
    rice: "Sticky Rice",
    sauce: "Korilla",
    toppings: ["Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper", "Kale"],
    drink: "Korchata",
    cost: 19
  },
  paid: false
};
const receipt3 = {
  person: "Matt",
  order: {
    main: "Salad Bowl",
    protein: "Organic Tofu",
    rice: "none",
    sauce: "K'lla",
    toppings: ["Blue Potato Salad", "Pico De Gallo", "Red Kimchi"],
    drink: "Sparkling Blood Orange Soda",
    cost: 20
  },
  paid: false
};
```

- Add the first receipt to the state of the app:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = receipt1;
  }
  //...
}
```

Make a Receipt component that renders the following data from the first receipt:

- person
- order
  - main
  - protein
  - rice
  - sauce
  - drink
  - cost

**Optional:** render the toppings

Add the next two receipts to state and make two more `Receipt` components so
that you get a view like this. Some css has been implemented already for you,
take a look at class names in the various css files.

## Part 2: Conditionally render the receipts

Right now, all the receipts are not paid.

Modify your render function in App.js to only render a component if the receipt
has not been paid.

Then go into the receipt data and change a paid value to true, then verify that
the receipt disappears.

## Part 3: Refactor for Dynamic Rendering

Obviously we don't want to have to modify our code every time we get a new
receipt. Let's instead put all the receipt data in an array and then map over it
to render the output.

Update your code so it renders the same, but instead of hard coding 3 receipts,
it maps over the array. You still want the receipts to display if they're
unpaid, and hide if they are paid.

<details>
  <summary>
  Receipt data in an array
  </summary>

```js
const receipts = [
  {
    person: "Karolin",
    order: {
      main: "Burrito",
      protein: "Organic Tofu",
      rice: "Purple Rice",
      sauce: "Green Crack",
      toppings: ["Baby Bok Choy", "Cucumber Kimchi"],
      drink: "Korchata",
      cost: 22
    },
    paid: false
  },
  {
    person: "Jerrica",
    order: {
      main: "Rice Bowl",
      protein: "Ginger Soy Chix",
      rice: "Sticky Rice",
      sauce: "Korilla",
      toppings: ["Yuzu Pickled Sweet Pepper", "Kale"],
      drink: "Korchata",
      cost: 19
    },
    paid: false
  },
  {
    person: "Matt",
    order: {
      main: "Salad Bowl",
      protein: "Organic Tofu",
      rice: "none",
      sauce: "K'lla",
      toppings: ["Blue Potato Salad", "Pico De Gallo", "Red Kimchi"],
      drink: "Sparkling Blood Orange Soda",
      cost: 20
    },
    paid: true
  }
];
```

</details>

## Part 4: Searching for receipts

Implement a search field that allows you to search by person. The search should
automatically update as you type, hiding every receipt that doesn't match the
name you're spelling out.

Hint: Think about how the search will work. How do you make something happen
while typing? What needs to happen? What values are you searching and comparing?
