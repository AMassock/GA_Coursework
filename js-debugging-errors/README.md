# JavaScript Errors and Debugging

Two of the most common challenges developers face are debugging and dealing with
errors. This is especially true for junior developers like yourself. The goal
of this lab is to give you exposure to some of the most common JavaScript errors
and what causes them.

Errors and bugs can have a variety of causes. For example,

- Missing an important piece of syntax (like `]`, `)`, `,`).
- Inaccurate access of an object property or an item in an array.
- Inaccurate or incomplete logic.
- Incorrect usage of a method.

JavaScript will throw an error with a message explaining (as best it can) what
the cause is. Interpreting these messages is a learned skill, one you have the
opportunity to practice with this lab!

## Prerequisites

- JavaScript data types and control flow
- Working with JavaScript objects and arrays
- JavaScript functions and methods
- Array methods and callbacks

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Work through the prompts in [`lib/`](lib/) and make a commit after completing each prompt.
1. Turn in the lab via a pull request.

Starter code is available in [`lib/`](lib/). A pull request is required for the
lab to be considered complete and turned in.

## Requirements

This lab contains 10 prompts inside [`lib/`](lib/). Each prompt includes a short
snippet of JavaScript code that has an error or bug in it. Your task is to
review the code and the error it creates, then determine the cause of the error
and how you can fix it.

Each prompt also asks three questions:

1. What is the error message?
1. What is causing the error?
1. How can you resolve/fix the error?

Write your answers inside of the javascript prompt file. Your answers can be
written or you can provide a fixed code snippet. Make a commit after each
prompt. Then turn your lab in with a pull request on this repository.

**Please format your responses in Markdown and as JavaScript comments. Use [this
cheetsheat](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet)
to see how to do so**

## Bonus

If you finish with these 11 bugs, explore some of the [debugging Katas](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/javascript?q=&r%5B%5D=-8&r%5B%5D=-7&r%5B%5D=-6&tags=Bugs&beta=false) on Code Wars.
