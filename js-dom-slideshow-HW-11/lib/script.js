/*

index.html contains a ul which is formatted to be a gallery.

A gallery is a row of images that rotate, showing each one for a set
period of time before showing the next image. After the last image,
the gallery starts over.

Follow along, reading each set of instructions carefully to build
out this gallery.

*/



/*

Step 1:
Using JavaScript, get the 'js-gallery' list and save it to a
variable. Then pull an array of the 'js-gallery-item' elements from
your 'js-gallery'.

Hint: you can call .querySelector on a node you've already retrieved from the DOM.

*/
const gallery = document.querySelector('.js-gallery');
const galleryNew = gallery.getElementsByClassName('js-gallery-item');
console.log(galleryNew);


/*

Step 2:
Transitioning our gallery from one slide to the next works like this:
We need to know the width of every slide (they're all the same). We
get the gallery and translate it to the left (so negative) by the
width of one slide, every few seconds until the last one. Then at
the last one, we translate it back to the starting point (which is
0).

To start, create a variable called slideCount that is equal to the
number of slides and another variable called slideWidth that is
equal to the width of a single slide.

To get the width, try .getBoundingClientRect() or .offsetWidth.

*/
let slideCount = galleryNew.length;
const slideWidth = gallery.offsetWidth;

/*

Step 3:
We need to set a timer to run ever 5 seconds. There are many ways to
set timers with JavaScript, the one we care about here is the
setInterval() function.

setInterval() takes two arguments: a reference to a function and the
interval in milliseconds between when setInterval should call that
function.

What's the difference between referencing and calling a function?

Also, it may seem counter intuitive but we want to save the result of
calling setInterval() to a variable.

Create a function called transitionSlide that, for now, just
`console.log`'s 'Called!' ever 5000 miliseconds

*/

let slideInterval = setInterval(transitionSlide, 5000);

/*

Step 4:
Now we're going to edit our transitionSlide function so that it will
transition the slides in our gallery.

Declare a variable called currentSlide and set it equal to 1.

Inside transitionSlide() we need to create an if/else statement where:
  (a) IF currentSlide is less than slideCount we do the following:
    - take our gallery and change it's transform style property so
    that it's equal to translateX( delta ), where delta is the width
    of a single slide times the value of currentSlide.
    - increment currentSlide
  (b) ELSE:
    - set the transform style property so that translateX() is 0
    - set currentSlide back to 1

Hint: delta should always be a negative number

*/

let currentSlide = 1;

function transitionSlide() {
  let transitionWidth = slideWidth * currentSlide;

  if(currentSlide < slideCount) {
    gallery.style.transform = `translateX(${-transitionWidth}px)`;
    currentSlide += 1;
  } else {
    gallery.style.transform = "translateX(0)";
    currentSlide = 1;
  }
}
