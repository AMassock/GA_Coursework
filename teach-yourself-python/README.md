# Teach Yourself Python

As we continue to learn Python and grow as
[evermore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXLgZZE072g) independent developers,
we want to challenge ourselves with more technical concepts that we tackle
[independently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

This lab gives you the opportunity to pick a challenging topic to learn and
progress through it independently.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

## Requirements

The following are a set of helpful and challenging technical book about Python.
Each is project-driven, meaning they'll guide you through interesting and
challenging problems.

Pick one of the following and spend the day working through the concepts and
challenges in the book.

1. [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
2. [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/)
