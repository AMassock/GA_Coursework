# Functions Practice

The purpose of this exercise is to practice working with functions. Think of it
as doing reps or practicing scales! The more you practice, the better you'll
get.

## Prerequisites

* Fundamental JavaScript: syntax, data types, and arrays
* Conditions, including `if`, `if`/`else`, and `if`/`else if`/`else`
* Loops, both `for` loops and `while` loops
* Functions, both arrow functions and function declarations

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). You are
required to turn in your submission by making a pull request on the original
repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

**Make a commit after each prompt.**

## Requirements

There are a series of prompts inside [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js).
Work through all of the prompts. Each prompt is in the form of a JavaScript
comment. Write your code to solve the prompt after the comment.

Some prompts will require you to practice researching methods we did not learn
in class.
