# AirBnB

Lots of websites, including Facebook and Airbnb, use a grid layout to display
common elements, such as information cards, photos, and other information. The
best way to learn how to create these different layouts is to try them
ourselves. So let's try recreating a portion of
[Airbnb's website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

## Prerequisites

- Layout with either CSS Grid or Flexbox

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
