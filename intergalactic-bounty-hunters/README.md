# Intergalactic Bounty Hunters

You've been going to meetup events and networking. You've been telling everyone
you're so excited to get a dev job that you'll take _any job_.

You run into a shadowy stranger, who asks you three times 'Really? Any job?' and
you continue to agree enthusiastically. Things go dark, and you wake up in
a strange place.

The shadowy stranger greets you and says 'Welcome to your new job! You are now
our dev who will be building an intergalactic bounty hunter database for us!'

You look around, notice some high end coffee and tea machines, an air hockey
table, nap rooms and floor to ceiling windows with a view of outer space. The
shadowy stranger takes you to your desk which has a fancy sit-to stand
adjustable hight desk with a swing bar, two big monitors, and Herman Miller
chair. You say to yourself 'Not bad! Not bad at all!'
